## Pregnancy Timer, Pregnancy Calendar

- I have this code repository open for friendly reference reasons. (As well as out of gratitude for the open source libraries used!)

-  Read about my motivations and the state of the libraries in my blogpost: [A Pregnancy Calendar tool](http://tomnorian.com/websites/pregnancy-calendar.html)

- The site is deployed at (note the word 'timer' .. crowded url namespace)

### [PregnancyTimer.com is a great pregnancy calendar](http://pregnancytimer.com)

## Are you an obstetrician? 

- This code can be easily added to most existing websites without changing your bigger setup.

- It would be easy to change the color scheme or add a backdrop photo of your practice to the animated section.

- I'd be open to selling exclusive rights to the tool, sell a multi-year license, or put your name on the existing site for very affordable rates.
